PROJECT: GOOGLE HOMEPAGE

For this project, I will deconstruct and reconstruct the existing Google Homepage. The links won't go anywhere and teh search box won't do anything when the search is submitted. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.
